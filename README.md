Simple 3D browser videogame project for the 2024 LSDJAM event.
The game is built using the 'Three.js' library and custom models made in Blender.

On first instance, this project is a little homage to the PS1 LSD videogame, and it tries to depict an interpretation of how dreams are experienced, but in the future this will be further developed into a more unique experience.

Besides LSD, this game was inspired by T-Sound's videoclip of "poliamor 2" (hence the name, though for this game it will be changed eventually):
